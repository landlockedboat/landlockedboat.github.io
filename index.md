Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.

I made this page in order to showcase my work on various projects and also as a way for visitors to contact me with inquiries or feedback about them.

I am currently active on [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/vike_pic/) :camera:, you can DM me at any time or send me an [email](mailto:valcazar96@gmail.com) :love_letter:. I'm also open to questions / coffee / mentoring / whatever.

## About me :seedling:

I've been building stuff with a computer since 2013. I am a very creative person and I value a great deal user experience and design.

Although my professional background is more back-end oriented atm, i have considerable experience as a hobbyst game dev, and would love to work with you in videogame related adventures! :video_game:

Recently, I've switched to freelance remote work. I'm open to hear about your project as long as you're open to remote workers :smile:.

## My games :video_game:
